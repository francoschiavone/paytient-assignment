# Paytient Frontend Assignment

This is the solution to a task posed by Paytient to assess applicants' ability to take a design and turn it into a TypeScript/React/Redux web app.

The implemented design can be found [here](https://www.figma.com/file/ZwwVBsm1IJsfFDzQZnuavc/Paytient-Homework-Assignment-Today-I-Learned-Reddit?node-id=0%3A1).

## Acceptance Criteria

- Use either the Create React App TypeScript or TypeScript + Redux Toolkit template to
  initialize and build a “paytient-assignment” git repository. Next.js, Gatsby, or other
  templates are also acceptable if that helps you build faster. Just be sure to use React,
  Redux, and TypeScript.

- Implement the Figma design using React. Though this is a small assignment, try to
  organize the components and code in a way that is mindful for scaling a typical frontend
  application. Feel free to use your favorite strategy for styling.

- For the list of articles to display, query (https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned.json), and
  store the data in Redux.

### Bonus

- Add helpful Jest tests for a React view, a Redux action creator, and a Redux reducer.

- Add a “typecheck” script that checks for any TypeScript compilation errors (and passes).

- Add mobile responsiveness.
